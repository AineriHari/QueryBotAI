The hero of the story is **Luna**. 

Here's why:

* **Protagonist:** Luna is the central character whose actions drive the plot.
* **Kindness and Courage:** She shows kindness and courage by helping the lost star even though it's a difficult task.
* **Problem-Solver:** She uses her resourcefulness and determination to find the star and return it to its place. 
* **Selfless Action:** Luna's actions are not motivated by personal gain, but by a desire to help someone in need.

Even though the star is a key character, it's Luna's actions that define the story and make her the hero.
