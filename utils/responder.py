"""
Module for generating responses using the Gemini generative AI model.

This module provides functionality to generate responses based on a user query and a set
of documents. It loads the specified generative AI model, processes the documents, and
generates a response using the provided query.

Key Functions:
- generate_response: Generates a response using the Gemini model based on the provided query and documents.

    Generates a response using the specified generative AI model.

    This function takes a query and a list of documents, loads the specified model, reads
    the content of the documents, and generates a response based on the query.

    Args:
        query (str): The query for which a response is to be generated.
        documents (list, optional): A list of file paths to documents for analysis. Defaults to None.
        model_name (str, optional): The name of the generative AI model to load. Defaults to "gemini-1.5-flash".

    Returns:
        str: The generated response or an error message if no documents are found or if an error occurs.
